## Golden Rules

- DO use snake_case rather than camelCase in your naming.
- DO write human readable keys for traits. Don’t use names like `ls` for lead score, just name it `lead_score`.
- DO use `_at` or `_date` as suffix to your trait name to let hull recognize the values as valid dates. You can pass either
  - a valid unix timestamp in seconds or milliseconds or
  - a valid string formatted according to ISO-8601
- DO make sure that you use the proper type for new traits because this cannot be changed later. For example, if you pass `"1234"` as the value for trait `customerId`, the trait will be always a treated as string, even if you intended it to be a number.
- DO NOT write code that generates dynamic keys for traits
- DO NOT use large arrays because they are slowing down the compute performance of your data. Arrays with up to 50 values are okay.
- DO NOT create infinite loops because they count towards the limits of your plan. Make sure to guard emitting events with `track` calls and to plan accordingly when setting a trait to the current timestamp.
